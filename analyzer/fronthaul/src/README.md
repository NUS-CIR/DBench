# Fronthaul Subsystem

he `fronthaul` subsystem is designed to analyze and process fronthaul traffic captured at various points in the network. It consists of three main modules: `transformer`, `inspector`, and `extractor`. Each module performs a specific step in the pipeline to extract and analyze data traffic patterns.

| Module      | Description                                                                 | Quick Start Command                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Transformer | Processes fronthaul traffic and generates PRB bitmaps.                      | `go run prb_bitmap.go`                                                             |
| Inspector   | Analyzes the PRB bitmap data generated by the transformer module.           | `go run bitmap_match.go`                                                               |
| Extractor   | Validates and compares PRB candidates with other pcap files to measure latency. | `go run timestamp.go -pcap=<path_to_pcap> -response -range_min=0 -range_max=10`         |

## Overview

### Transformer

The `transformer` module processes fronthaul traffic captured at the Radio Unit (RU) and identifies packets with non-zero Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs). It generates bitmaps indicating the presence of data traffic within these PRBs.

#### Quick Start

```sh
go run prb_bitmap.go
```

### Inspector
The inspector module processes the PRB bitmap CSV files generated by the transformer module. It performs various analyses to help understand the data traffic patterns within the Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs).

#### Quick Start

```sh
go run bitmap_match.go
```

### Extractor
The extractor module validates and compares the PRB candidates identified by the `inspector` module with other pcap files. This helps in determining the processing latency of different components in the network.

```sh
go run timestamp.go -pcap=<path_to_pcap> -response
```

### Notes
- Ensure that all dependencies are installed for each module.
- Follow the specific instructions for each module to correctly process and analyze the data.
