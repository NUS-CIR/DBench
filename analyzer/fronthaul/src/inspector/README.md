# Inspector

The `inspector` module is designed to analyze and inspect the processed PRB bitmap data generated by the transformer module. This module provides tools to further analyze the bitmaps to locate PRBs carrying user data by the abnormal bitmap pattern than background PRBs.

## Overview

The `inspector` module processes the PRB bitmap CSV files generated by the transformer module. It performs various analyses to help understand the data traffic patterns within the Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs).

## Quick Start

### Installation

Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

#### Go Dependencies

```sh
go get github.com/google/gopacket
go get github.com/google/gopacket/pcap
```

> If you go through steps from the `transformer`, then you are good to go, no need to install the dependencies again

### Usage

1. Run the Transformer: Ensure you have run the transformer module to produce the PRB bitmap data.
2. Run the Inspector: Execute the inspector script to analyze the PRB bitmap data:

    ```sh
    cd inspector
    go run inspector.go
    ```

    **Output**:  
    This script generates analysis reports based on the PRB bitmap data in the `../../data/prb_bitmaps/ directory`, namely `candidates` for data PRBs in the `../../data/candidate/candidate.csv`

### Notes
- Ensure that the input CSV file paths are correctly specified in the script.
